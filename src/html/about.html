          In recent years, I have worked in the field of educational services. By the nature of my activity, I had to deal with work in a variety of programs, and I became interested in the process of their creation. Friends suggested taking courses in C++. I quickly got hooked and after a while I switched to learning how to create web pages. The very idea that you can design a web page and manage its elements seemed interesting to me, so I came to learn the JavaScript language. With my background in C++, learning JavaScript came relatively quickly to me. Now I am improving my professional competencies by taking a course to get more in-depth knowledge of JavaScript and learning the React library
